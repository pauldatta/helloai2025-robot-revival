### Part 1: Lost in the City

Aum ran away from home when he was just seven years old. At first, the freedom of being on his own in the bustling city of Bangkok was exciting. However, without the ability to read or write, and with no ID or full name, that freedom soon turned to despair.

- **Explore the Diorama:** Navigate to the busy **markets and alleys of Bangkok**. This is where Aum spent years wandering, feeling hopeless and alone as he struggled to survive.

### Part 2: A Glimmer of Hope

Fifteen years later, while in an internet cafe, Aum made a life-changing discovery. He saw people searching for information online, something he couldn't do. Then, he noticed the **Google voice search** microphone icon. He was amazed to find a tool that could understand his voice and turn his spoken words into text.

For the first time in over a decade, he had a way to search for the home he so desperately missed.

### Part 3: The Search

Using Google voice search and Google Earth, Aum began to piece together his past. All he had were faded memories of three key places from his childhood:

- A canal
- A market
- Railroad tracks

- **Explore the Diorama:** Use the controls to find these locations on the map. See how Aum used satellite imagery to connect his fragmented memories, searching for a place that looked familiar.

### Part 4: The Path Home

Aum's search led him to **Sri Khema Market**. As he explored the area on Google Earth, the memories came flooding back. He instantly recognized the layout and, finally, his own house. After 15 years of being lost, he had found his home on the map.

With this crucial information, Aum contacted **The Mirror Foundation**, an organization that helps find missing persons.

- **Explore the Diorama:** Follow Aum's train journey from Hua Hin back to Bangkok as he finally heads home.

### Part 5: The Reunion

In 2017, thanks to his own determination and the power of accessible technology, Aum was emotionally reunited with his father. The tears of joy and sadness marked the end of a long, difficult journey.

Today, Aum uses his experience to help other lost children find their way back to their families. His story is a powerful testament to hope, perseverance, and how technology can change lives in the most profound ways.
