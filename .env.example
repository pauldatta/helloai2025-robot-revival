# This file provides an example of the environment variables needed for the project.
# For local development, copy this file to a new file named `.env`
# and replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key.

# Your Google Gemini API key
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Set the operating environment.
# Use 'dev' for local development to connect to the hardware emulator.
# Use 'prod' (or unset) for connecting to the real Arduino and OpenCR boards.
AUM_ENVIRONMENT="dev"

# --- Port Configuration ---
# The application will use the correct set of ports based on AUM_ENVIRONMENT.

# Production ports for the real hardware
MAIN_CONTROLLER_PORT="/dev/tty.usbmodem12345" # <-- Replace with your actual Arduino port
ROBOTIC_ARM_PORT="/dev/tty.usbmodem67890"   # <-- Replace with your actual OpenCR port

# Development ports used by `socat` and the hardware emulator
MAIN_CONTROLLER_PORT_EMULATOR="./main_controller_emu_port"
